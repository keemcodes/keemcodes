## Hi, I'm finally here
Hi My name is Akeem Anderson. I'm a Software Engineer based in Atlanta. I finally decided to bite the bullet and get on GitHub. I have alot of interesting things I would love to share.

## How did I learn to code?
I'm a self taught engineer, I been coding since I was 12-13, I'm currently 26. I learned to code with pure trial and error, messing around with game modding/hacking, making game harvesting bots, social media bots, and private server development in SA:MP taught me mostly everything I know.

I ran a small SA:MP server for a few years, I picked up so much during this time.

## What did private server development in SA:MP teach me?
* I learned web development because I wanted to make a custom website for my game server
* I learned how to use SQL because my game server stored player files in SQL.
* I learned how to use Linux machines because Linux SA:MP servers were cheaper than Windows :)

Basically... everything I learned over the years in my youth was sparked because of my interest in gaming.

## Why did I learn to code
Simple, I wanted to make my own private game server which required a pretty extensive knowledge base in coding. Over years of coppling together code as a teenager, asking for help on the SA:MP coding forums... I learned how to code. I always tell people I learned how to code on accident haha. It was first an innocent hobby... later morphed into a serious passion.

## What do I do now?
* I work for Hartsfield Jackson International Airport as a Software Engineer tasked in Web Development.
* I manage all of the airport's public facing websites.
* I build custom internal applications for the airport
* I build custom web features and improve user experience
